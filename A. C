Here's a simple example of a basic C program:

Code:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Declare a variable to store the user's name
    char name[50];
    
    // Print a message to the user
    printf("Enter your name: ");
    
    // Take input from the user
    scanf("%s", name);
    
    // Print a welcome message
    printf("Hello, %s! Welcome to the world of C programming.\n", name);
    
    return 0;
}

Explanation:

1. #include <stdio.h>: This is a header file that includes functions like printf and scanf.


2. int main(): The main function is the entry point of the program.


3. char name[50];: Declares a string variable to store the user's name.


4. printf: Prints a message to the console.


5. scanf: Takes input from the user.


6. return 0;: Indicates the program ended successfully.



How It Works:

1. The program asks the user to enter their name.


2. It reads the input
